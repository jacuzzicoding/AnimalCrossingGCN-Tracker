# MacOS Category Switching Bug Fix Documentation
Issue #17: Category switching not working properly on macOS

## The Problem
The category switching bug in v0.5.0-alpha and v0.5.1-alpha manifested as:
- Buttons registering clicks but UI not updating
- Debug logs showing correct state changes
- Multiple NavigationLink taps being registered
- UI remaining unresponsive on macOS specifically

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from how SwiftUI was handling navigation state and view updates on macOS. The previous implementation created view instances directly within NavigationLink, which wasn't efficiently managing state updates on macOS.

## The Solution

### 1. Previous Implementation
```swift
NavigationLink { 
    category.detailView(for: item)
} label: {
    CollectibleRow(item: item, category: category)
}
```

### 2. New Implementation
Changed to use type-based navigation with explicit destinations:
```swift
// In CategorySection
NavigationLink(value: item) {
    CollectibleRow(item: item, category: category)
}

// In main navigation stack
NavigationSplitView {
    mainContent
        .navigationDestination(for: Fossil.self) { fossil in
            FossilDetailView(fossil: fossil)
        }
        .navigationDestination(for: Bug.self) { bug in
            BugDetailView(bug: bug)
        }
        .navigationDestination(for: Fish.self) { fish in
            FishDetailView(Fish: fish)
        }
        .navigationDestination(for: Art.self) { art in
            ArtDetailView(art: art)
        }
}
```

### 3. State Management
CategoryManager remained unchanged:
```swift
class CategoryManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var selectedCategory: Category = .fossils {
        didSet {
            print("Category changed from \(oldValue) to \(selectedCategory)")
        }
    }
}
```

## Why It Works
1. Uses SwiftUI's type-based navigation routing
2. Lets SwiftUI manage view creation and state updates more efficiently
3. Better handles the navigation state on macOS
4. Maintains proper view lifecycle management

## Implementation Notes
- No changes needed to the data models
- Compatible with both iOS and macOS
- Preserves all existing functionality
- More efficient view creation and management

## Future Considerations
- Monitor SwiftUI navigation performance on future macOS updates
- Consider adding transition animations
- May want to add loading states for larger datasets

## Related Files Modified
- ContentView.swift
- No changes needed to:
  - FloatingCategorySwitcher.swift
  - MainListView.swift
  - Model files

## Testing Requirements
- Test category switching multiple times
- Verify navigation stack doesn't accumulate
- Confirm detail view updates properly
- Check performance on older macOS versions
